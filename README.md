# Tech Blog

## About

This project involved writing an entire full stack application, which in this case was a tech blog. This involved the use of `MYSQL2` and 'Sequelise' to query our database, `express` to handle requests being made to the server, `express-session` and `connect-session-sequelise` to handle sessions and cookies and `handlebars` to handle the templating of our data to display on our webpage. With the tech blog, you can either log in (see seed files for credentials) or create a new user. Once logged in. a user can see the homepage which consists of posts made by all users. By cicking on a post, you can see all the comments made on a post. if you ckick on 'dashboard', you are greeted by a message and have te ability to create a new post and can see all the posts that you have made, as well as all the comments on the posts. by clickin on a post you made while on the 'dashboard' page, you can update or delete your post, which will also delete all associated comments. If you click the 'logout' button in the header of the page, you are logged out
